PiAutomator
===========

Simple Python lib that allows you to read values from sensors etc. on the Pi and then trigger receivers into certain states.

Currently using this with a DHT22 sensor wired and a wired switch (KlikAanKlikUit) 
to switch the fan when it gets too humid in the bathroom

The setup is created in such a way that it should be easy enough to add more and different types of sensors and the
types of receivers should also be able to get a bit more variation, although I'll probably stick with kaku for now.
